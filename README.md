# target-deathrates
In this group project, our team was provided with a dataset of the mean per capita (100,000) cancer mortalities, for various counties across the United States. Our task was to determine which of our multivariate X variables were responsible for increases in the cancer mortality rate, and to build an effective linear model with our retained variables to predict cancer mortality rates for counties moving forward. Our team used cross-validation to build a model that was effective out-of-sample.  Next, we set a threshold for cancer mortality rates, and then employed a Logistic Regression to classify counties using our constructed thresholds. To assess the predictive power of our model, our team assessed the accuracy score of our model, the sensitivity, precision, and recall scores using cross-validation.
